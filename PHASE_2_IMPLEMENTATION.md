### **Before Phase 2:**
```
Basic Information:
• Tenant: John Doe
• Current Rent: $1200
• Proposed Rent: $1600
• Evidence Score: 85%
```

### **After Phase 2:**
```
Executive Summary:
This case involves a 33.3% rent increase ($400 monthly) imposed by 
ABC Properties on the property at 123 Main Street. This increase would 
raise the tenant's rent burden from 28.5% to 42.3% of household income, 
exceeding HUD affordability standards and creating substantial financial 
hardship. Market analysis reveals the proposed rent is 18% above 
comparable properties in the area, indicating the increase lacks market 
justification. The case is supported by 85% evidence completeness, with 
all required documentation assembled.

### **Dynamic Recommendations:**
